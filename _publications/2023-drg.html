We present DRG-Keyboard, a gesture keyboard enabled by dual IMU rings, allowing the user to swipe the thumb on the index fingertip to perform word gesture typing as if typing on a miniature QWERTY keyboard. With dual IMUs attached to the user's thumb and index finger, DRG-Keyboard can 1) measure the relative attitude while mapping it to the 2D fingertip coordinates and 2) detect the thumb's touch-down and touch-up events combining the relative attitude data and the synchronous frequency domain data, based on which a fingertip gesture keyboard can be implemented. To understand users typing behavior on the index fingertip with DRG-Keyboard, we collected and analyzed user data in two typing manners. Based on the statistics of the gesture data, we enhanced the elastic matching algorithm with rigid pruning and distance measurement transform. The user study showed DRG-Keyboard achieved an input speed of 12.9 WPM (68.3\% of their gesture typing speed on the smartphone) for all participants. The appending study also demonstrated the superiority of DRG-Keyboard for better form factors and wider usage scenarios. To sum up, DRG-Keyboard not only achieves good text entry speed merely on a tiny fingertip input surface, but is also well accepted by the participants for the input subtleness, accuracy, good haptic feedback, and availability.
