By overlaying time-synced user comments on videos, Danmu creates a socially engaging co-watching experience for online viewers. However, its visual-centric design poses significant challenges for blind and low vision (BLV) viewers. Our formative study identified three primary challenges that hinder BLV viewers' engagement with Danmu: the lack of visual context, the disorganization of comments, and their obtrusive presentation alongside videos. To address these limitations, we present DanmuA11y, a system that enhances social engagement for BLV viewers by transforming Danmu into multi-viewer discussions. DanmuA11y incorporates three core features: (1) Augmenting Danmu with Visual Context, (2) Seamlessly Integrating Danmu into Videos, and (3) Presenting Danmu via Multi-Viewer Discussions. Evaluation with twelve BLV viewers demonstrated that DanmuA11y significantly improved Danmu comprehension, provided smooth viewing experiences, and fostered strong social connections among viewers. We further distill implications for improving non-visual accessibility in video-based social media and live-streaming platforms.
