<h2>HCI Ph.D. Positions</h2>


<p>Our lab is recruiting Ph.D. students to join the Department of Computer Science at University of Rochester in 2024 Fall. We work on enabling novel interactions with Mixed Reality avatars (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581027" class="black b underline-dot hover-cmu-red link">HandAvatar</a>), interfaces (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3472749.3474750" class="black b underline-dot hover-cmu-red link">SemanticAdapt</a>), and environments (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3526113.3545646" class="black b underline-dot hover-cmu-red link">ColorDepth</a>); augmenting multimodal communications between user and interface (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3332165.3347950" class="black b underline-dot hover-cmu-red link">PrivateTalk</a>), and between multiple users (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10049667" class="black b underline-dot hover-cmu-red link">ConeSpeech</a>); modeling user perceptual and behavioral patterns in Mixed Reality interactions (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3534590" class="black b underline-dot hover-cmu-red link">BodyOffset</a>).  </p>

<h3>How to apply?</h3>
<p>The admission process of URCS for PhD students is centralized, and you can find all information <a href="https://www.cs.rochester.edu/graduate/phd-program.html" class="black b underline-dot hover-cmu-red link">here</a>. Applications will get looked at by the PhD admissions committee. All full-time PhD students receive full-tuition scholarships and stipends, and there is no application fee to apply for the program. </p>

<p>Applicants do not necessarily need to have undergraduate degrees in computer science, while should have solid programming skills or they are motivated to pick up the skills through the program. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of HCI research, it might be a necessary skill to quickly pick up new skills. </p>

<p> Regarding the application package, you can highlight your interest in working in the lab in your statement of purpose. In addition to the statement of purpose, UR requires a diversity statement in your application package. You can find advice on how to write one <a href="https://careereducation.rochester.edu/resources/how-do-i-write-a-diversity-statement/" class="black b underline-dot hover-cmu-red link">here</a>. The deadline for 2024 Fall admission is January 1, 2024. </p>

<h3>ROC-HCI Group</h3>
Our lab is part of <a href="http://roc-hci.com/" class="black b underline-dot hover-cmu-red link">ROC-HCI Group</a>, where Dr. Yukang Yan serves a co-director. ROC-HCI strives for technical novelty in advancing scientific discovery and addressing real-life challenges in learning (e.g. K-12 AI literacy, socio-emotional learning, scientific inquiry), social interaction (e.g. collaboration, communication, credibility), and wellness for people with diverse abilities and needs (e.g. Autism, Deaf and Hard of Hearing, severe anxiety, ageing). ROC-HCI offers an inclusive and collaborative learning environment that respects diverse academic and cultural backgrounds.


<h3>AR/VR initiative</h3>
The University of Rochester has launched a multi-faceted <a href="https://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/new-training-in-ar-vr-tech-gives-rochester-doctoral-students-an-edge-397062/" class="black b underline-dot hover-cmu-red link">initiative</a> to establish world-leading AR/VR research across the campus. In 2020, the university received a 5-year National Science Foundation award to offer interdisciplinary educational traineeships and fellowships to prepare PhD candidates for transformative research in AR/VR across CS, Brain and Cognitive Science, Optics, Electronics and Computing Engineering and related fields. 

<h3>Yes, it is a new lab!</h3>
